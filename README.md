# Covid-19-Detection-On-Chest-X-Ray-Images-Using-CNN


Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely infectious disease and possibly causes acute
respiratory distress or in severe cases may lead to death. There has already been some research in
dealing with corona virus using machine learning algorithms. In this research, we show how
convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be useful in detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray
(CXR) images. We leverage CNN-based pre-trained models as feature extractors to substantiate
transfer learning and add our own CNN classifier in detecting COVID-19. In this regard, we
evaluate performance of pre-trained “VGG-16” models by fine-tuning the weights from some of
the top layers as well as the classifier that we built . Both models are evaluated through publicly
available data repositories containing healthy and infected (COVID-19) chest X-ray images. The
models show a high degree of accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. We believe that the models
will aid medical professionals with improved and faster patient screening and pave a way to
further COVID-19 research.
